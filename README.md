## Do Not Disturb Script for Windows 7 & 8.x
A very simple batch script to disable notifications for Win 7, 8 & 8.1 <br>
It disables 2 types of notifications:
1. **Balloon**: The classic Win 7 desktop notifications that appear in the tray menu.
2. **Metro/Toast**: The new ones introduced in Win 8.x that appear on top right corner.

> **⚠️ Warning:**  
> Windows Explorer will restart when the script runs, in order to apply changes, obviously you won't lose your work, but the directories you were in will be closed.

## Notes
1. I tested it on Win 8.1 and it worked.
2. Not tested on Win 7, but it should work, you can also comment out the script lines that are specific for Win 8.x.
3. For Win 10/11, Idk, is it necessary?
4. For Win 8 & 8.1, toast notifications can be simply turned off from the quick right settings menu; but for Win 7, Idk if there is a simpler option.

## Disclamer
Finally, I must admit, I'm not the real author, it's just AI :(
